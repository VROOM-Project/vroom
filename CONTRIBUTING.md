# Usage and bug reports

If you encounter any trouble while building or running the code,
please check:

- [the wiki](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom/wiki) for build
and usage instructions
- the API documentation at [docs/API.md](docs/API.md)
- open or closed issues covering a similar problem.

# Contributing code

Contributions to the code-base are very welcome. If you plan to work
on something you want to submit a PR for, feel free to open an issue
in order to discuss implementation details or make sure your idea fits
with the scope or aim of the project.

## Branching

* The tip of the `master` branch is the current dev version.
* Separate tasks are done in branches, using explicit names like
`feature/*`, `experiment/*`, `refactor/*`, `fix/*` whenever possible.
* Branches are usually merged using a non-fast-forward merge.

## Coding conventions

### Miscellaneous

- Custom types use **PascalCase**
- Variables and functions use **snake_case**
- Non-static private data members use underscore-prefixed **_snake_case**

### Namespaces

A generic `vroom` namespace contains every type that needs to be
exposed, such as `Job`, `Vehicle`, `Location`, `Amount` etc. Then
there are several namespace specializations.

- `utils`: helper data structures, functions and algorithms
- `io`: everything related to command-line arguments, input and output handling
- `routing`: wrappers for the routing layer
- `heuristics`: VRP heuristics stuff
- `ls`: local search phase stuff
- `tsp`: specific code for the TSP
- `cvrp`: CVRP-specific local search operators
- `vrptw`: VRPTW-specific local search operators

### Automatic formatting

To ensure a consistent formatting of the code-base, please run
`./scripts/format.sh` prior to submitting a PR. A convenient way to
automate code formatting is to use a commit hook. Create the file
`.git/hooks/pre-commit` containing:

```
#!/bin/sh

./scripts/format.sh
```

then make sure it's executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`.
