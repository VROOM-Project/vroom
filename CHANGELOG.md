  multi-threading (#26).

### Fixed

### Added

- Compute optimized "open" trips with user-defined start and/or end.
- Special extra handling for asymmetric problems in the local search
  phase.
- New local search operator to improve results in specific asymmetric
  context (e.g. many locations in a dense urban area with lots of
  one-way streets).

- Append the `tour` key to the solution in any case.

### Changed

- U-turns enabled when retrieving detailed route geometry from OSRM

  +6.57% in this release).
- Core refactor for undirected graph (#13), tsp structure and tsplib
  loader (#24), heuristics, local search and 2-opt
  implementation. Results in a less intensive memory usage and faster
  computing times (on TSPLIB files, the computing times dropped by
  more than a factor of 2 on average).
